[Style guide](http://roykolak.github.com/chrome-bootstrap/)

Chrome's UI stylings look pretty nice and are advancing quickly. In order to make top quanlity extensions, apps, and other one offs that look and feel like Chrome's system apps, these styles must be exposed for easy reuse.

This project aims at accomplishing this goal while keeping the scope extremely simple.

Scope
----------------

* Reusable selectors
* CSS animations
* I18n'ed properties
* Images encoded as strings

And that's it. Let's keep it simple!

Setup
---------------

Chrome bootstrap is packaged as a npm package so run the following to install dependencies

    $ npm install

To compile css with each less change, use the start command

    $ npm start
